# KOrunner 🏃‍♂️💨

KOrunner is a lightweight, custom-built endless runner game for Android, written entirely in Kotlin. It demonstrates how to create a performant 2D game using standard Android APIs without relying on heavy external game engines.

## 🎮 Overview

The player controls a duck that must jump over mushroom obstacles to survive. The game features a custom game loop, physics-based movement, and dynamic rendering using the Android `Canvas` and `SurfaceView`.

## ✨ Features

*   **Three Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard modes to test your reflexes.
*   **Custom Game Engine**: Built from scratch using `SurfaceView` for optimized performance (60 FPS target).
*   **Procedural Generation**: Obstacles and clouds are generated algorithmically for endless replayability.
*   **Physics System**: Implements gravity, velocity, and collision detection.
*   **Immersive Experience**: Full-screen mode with hidden system UI.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

*   **Language**: Kotlin
*   **UI/Rendering**: Android SDK (`SurfaceView`, `Canvas`, `Paint`)
